# Next Gen Password Manager!

PassCrypt is a platform where you can store your passwords, debit/credit card details, secret notes and more. You only need a single platform that will take away your pain to remember your important passwords. Also it work seamlessly

## Motivation

We use internet a lot and as a result we create accounts on different websites like Twitter, Unsight, Gmail etc, and this list goes on... and as a result we had to create so many accounts with different passwords, which makes it quite overwhelming to remember all all the passwords and we tend to forget them.

So to fix this problem, I thought why not to just build an application that will take this pain away, and will provide a secure way to store passwords and other personal information.
**As a result I built PassCrypt**

#### PassCrypt is a safe place where you can store your private informations seamlessly also its secure as we hash your details with best hashing algorithms out there, so even we don't know what your passwords are...
